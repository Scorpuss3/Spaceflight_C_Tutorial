This is the most basic program you might find: a single C source file with the extension .c

To compile this, you will need a command line with gcc installed (like MinGW).

gcc <source files> -o <output executable filename>

So for our example:

	gcc main.c -o main.exe

This .exe can now be run from the command line. Note that the executable name can be whatever
you like. On linux the file extension can be different or even removed.
